       "\"Published: 2024-07-22\\nTitle: Attention Is All You Need But You Don't Need All Of It For Inference of Large Language Models\\nAuthors: Georgy Tyukin, Gbetondji J-S Dovonon, Jean Kaddour, Pasquale Minervini\\nSummary: The inference demand for LLMs has skyrocketed in recent months, and serving\\nmodels with low latencies remains challenging due to the quadratic input length\\ncomplexity of the attention layers. In this work, we investigate the effect of\\ndropping MLP and attention layers at inference time on the performance of\\nLlama-v2 models. We find that dropping dreeper attention layers only marginally\\ndecreases performance but leads to the best speedups alongside dropping entire\\nlayers. For example, removing 33\\\\% of attention layers in a 13B Llama2 model\\nresults in a 1.8\\\\% drop in average performance over the OpenLLM benchmark. We\\nalso observe that skipping layers except the latter layers reduces performances\\nfor more layers skipped, except for skipping the attention layers.\\n\\nPublished: 2021-07-16\\nTitle: All the attention you need: Global-local, spatial-channel attention for image retrieval\\nAuthors: Chull Hwan Song, Hye Joo Han, Yannis Avrithis\\nSummary: We address representation learning for large-scale instance-level image\\nretrieval. Apart from backbone, training pipelines and loss functions, popular\\napproaches have focused on different spatial pooling and attention mechanisms,\\nwhich are at the core of learning a powerful global image representation. There\\nare different forms of attention according to the interaction of elements of\\nthe feature tensor (local and global) and the dimensions where it is applied\\n(spatial and channel). Unfortunately, each study addresses only one or two\\nforms of attention and applies it to different problems like classification,\\ndetection or retrieval.\\n  We present global-local attention module (GLAM), which is attached at the end\\nof a backbone network and incorporates all four forms of attention: local and\\nglobal, spatial and channel. We obtain a new feature tensor and, by spatial\\npooling, we learn a powerful embedding for image retrieval. Focusing on global\\ndescriptors, we provide empirical evidence of the interaction of all forms of\\nattention and improve the state of the art on standard benchmarks.\""

       "AIMessage(content='\\n<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking about \"cookie\" as a snack. Let me start by defining what a cookie is. I know cookies are baked snacks, so I should mention the basic ingredients like flour, sugar, butter, and maybe some additives for flavor.\\n\\nWait, maybe I should also differentiate between types of cookies. There are so many variations—like chocolate chip, oatmeal, macarons, and shortbread. Including examples would make the explanation clearer.\\n\\nI should also talk about their texture. Some are crispy, others are chewy or soft. That\\'s important because texture is a key aspect of cookies. Oh, and cultural differences! I remember that in the UK they call them biscuits, right? So mentioning that could be helpful, especially if the user is from a different country.\\n\\nWhat about the history? It might be useful to note that cookies originated as a way to test baking temperatures, like the origin of the term \"test cake.\" But maybe that\\'s too much detail for a simple definition. Hmm.\\n\\nAlso, the ingredients can vary. Some use alternative flours or sweeteners. Maybe mention that? And baking processes—different techniques affect the outcome. Like using refrigeration or chilling the dough first.\\n\\nWait, the user might also be interested in how cookies are served. They can be enjoyed plain, with milk, or part of desserts. Should I include serving suggestions?\\n\\nOh, and dietary preferences. There are gluten-free and vegan options now. Including that shows they\\'re adaptable for different diets.\\n\\nLet me structure this: start with a basic definition, then ingredients, types, texture, cultural names, and maybe a bit about their popularity and serving. Keep it clear and concise without getting too technical. Make sure to highlight the key points so the user gets a comprehensive understanding without overwhelming them.\\n</think>\\n\\nA **cookie**, often referred to as a **biscuit** outside the United States and Canada, is a popular baked snack made from ingredients such as **flour, sugar, butter, eggs, and leavening agents** (like baking soda or baking powder). They are typically small, flat, and often sweetened, though some varieties can be savory. \\n\\n### Key Characteristics:\\n1. **Ingredients**:  \\n   - Base ingredients usually include flour, sugar, and fat (butter, oil, or shortening).  \\n   - Additions like chocolate chips, nuts, spices, or extracts (e.g., vanilla) add flavor and texture.  \\n   - Gluten-free or vegan options use alternatives like almond flour or plant-based oils.\\n\\n2. **Texture**:  \\n   - Varies widely depending on the recipe:  \\n     - **Crispy** (e.g., shortbread),  \\n     - **Chewy** (e.g., chocolate chip),  \\n     - **Soft** (e.g., sandwich cookies with filling),  \\n     - **Crumbly** (e.g., ginger snaps).\\n\\n3. **Types**:  \\n   - Classic examples include **chocolate chip**, **oatmeal**, **macarons**, **biscotti**, and **spritz**.  \\n   - Regional variations exist, such as **Scottish shortbread**, **German Lebkuchen**, or **Japanese melon pan**.\\n\\n4. **Cultural Names**:  \\n   - **UK/Ireland/Australia**: \"Biscuit.\"  \\n   - **India**: \"Biscuit\" or \"cookie\" (e.g., Marie biscuit).  \\n   - **France**: \"Biscuit\" (from the Latin *bis coctum*, meaning \"twice-baked\").\\n\\n5. **Serving**:  \\n   - Eaten plain, dipped in milk, coffee, or paired with tea.  \\n   - Used in desserts (e.g., ice cream sandwiches, cookie dough treats).\\n\\n### History:\\nCookies originated as small test cakes (hence \"test bake\"), later evolving into the varied snacks we know today. They are enjoyed globally and come in countless flavors and styles, adapting to dietary trends like gluten-free or low-sugar options.\\n\\nIn short, a cookie is a versatile, portable treat that combines simplicity and creativity, beloved for its convenience and indulgent appeal! 🍪', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 855, 'prompt_tokens': 19, 'total_tokens': 874, 'completion_time': 2.128095453, 'prompt_time': 0.005800302, 'queue_time': 0.35787113400000004, 'total_time': 2.133895755}, 'model_name': 'qwen-qwq-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_a91d9c2cfb', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-17e128fd-4b97-445a-9ce1-68f65c01df46-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 19, 'output_tokens': 855, 'total_tokens': 874})"

[...] March was all about expanding AI across our products to make them even more helpful. The Gemini app was upgraded to include new features like personalization, Canvas and Audio Overviews, and we made our Deep Research and Gems features available at no cost. We also added our speedy Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking experimental model under the hood — and one-upped ourselves just a few days later by making our most intelligent AI model, Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental), available to all Gemini users. [...] We launched three new initiatives to protect and restore nature using AI. A startup accelerator, kicking off in May 2025, includes programming, mentoring and technical support from Google. Google.org is also providing $3 million to support AI-enabled solutions for biodiversity, bioeconomy and agriculture from Brazilian nonprofits.
